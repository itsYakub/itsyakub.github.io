## Hello, I'm Jakub!

I'm a 21-years-old programmer from Poland interested mostly in Low-Level Programming, OSDev, Graphics Programming and GameDev.

## Brief history:

My coding adventure started during my high-school days in 2021 where I discovered C++. Then moved to working with games in Unity using C#.
A few transitions between the engines finally made me stray away from ready solutions in favor of building everything by myself.
In 2023, after finishing cs50, I've became really used to C and C++, Low-Level and Operating Systems programming.
From there I started working with OpenGL, software rasterization, kernel manipulations to the point where I am today.
